<h1>Playing with imagination: 3 conundrums</h1>

<p>Imaginary numbers are a sight to behold.</p>

<p>Not only for the scholars learning it for the first time, but for anyone that understands and appreciates the complexity(pun intended) it beholds.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For those reader's who are unaware of the imaginary:</p>

<p>$$i^2 = -1$$</p>

<p>$$\therefore  i = \sqrt {-1}$$</p>

<p>it's almost magical how the Heron of Alexandria first came across the problem of square rooting negative numbers and in the 1500, through all the trials and tribulations of time, humanity finally accepted the existence of $i$— the imaginary number.</p>

<p>And therefore, a new set of numbers were born: the complex numbers.</p>

<h2>Existence</h2>

<p>Just like negative numbers don't make sense in the real world, neither does i .</p>

<p>However, here is a thought experiment for the reader:</p>

<p>What exists more: the number $7$ or $i$ ?</p>

<p>This is a very thought provoking question as it goes in the depths between maths and philosophy and questions the exact meaning for something to exist .</p>

<p>To first tackle this philosophical problem we must define the meaning of existence.</p>

<p>if we take the Merriam Webster dictionary's definition of what it means to "exist" then it would be defined as the following:</p>

<p>"to have real being whether material or spiritual""</p>

<p>The problem is quite visible at this stage because by definition to exist means to be real. but unfortunately for our case:</p>

<p>$i$ the imaginary unit is the exact opposite of "real"</p>

<p>However we must consider the fact that this definition is quite generic and is not specific in this mathematical context.</p>

<p>In $mathematics$ to exist means that an object satisfies a given set of properties/ conditions.</p>

<p>Therefore, one is able to argue that my question has incorrect syntax and therefore (mathematically) my question is wrong.</p>

<p>As the nature of the question contradicts itself which leads to disproof through contradiction.</p>

<h2>Philosophical approach</h2>

<p>But philosophically thinking to exist is to have meaning in the world and the imaginary unit has most definitely it has a meaning.</p>

<p>The imaginary unit was first invented by…</p>

<p>to solve the problem of…</p>

<p>therefore, $i$ has a meaning</p>

<p>Often after much deliberation most people come to the final conclusion that they both exist equally and have meaning in their own respective sense (philosophically).</p>

<p>Even though we probably used the number seven a lot more in the real world, one also understands that I have an equally infinite use cases as seven.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, someone could possibly argue that I, the imaginary unit exists more than the number 7. this is due to the fact that seven is just a common number and doesn't hold any more meaning than other numbers like $8, 9, 10$.</p>

<p>However, $i$ holds a lot more meaning because it's the basic unit for all complex numbers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, one could even argue that the set of all integers is merely a proper subset of gaussian integers (written in the form of $m +ni$ when $n = 0$)</p>

<p>Here is a very easy and brief proof:</p>

<p>Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ ($a$ is an integer)</p>

<p>It can be written in the form of $m+ni$ given the conditions below are satisfied</p>

<p>Let $a = m$</p>

<p>and $n = 0$</p>

<p>$$\therefore a = m+ni$$</p>

<p>$$\because n = 0$$</p>

<p>$$\therefore a = m + 0 =a+0$$</p>

<p>$$= a$$</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{QED}$$</p>

<p>That point aside, there are many interesting things that you can do with $i$.</p>

<p>One of my favorite use of the imaginary unit is below.</p>

<h2>The 3 conundrums of $\sqrt{-1}$:</h2>

<p>And if we don't follow certain very specific rules laid out just for the imaginary unit, we can often prove things that are certainly not true.</p>

<p>Here are the three ways I found to metaphorically "break mathematics "</p>

<p>And you will understand why this is in "quotation marks" soon as these proofs although look sleek, they are sly in nature and cross fine lines in the rules of i .</p>

<h3>Problem 1:</h3>

<p>We know that $i^2 = -1$</p>

<p>$$\therefore i = ±\sqrt{-1}$$</p>

<p>$$i = ±1$$</p>

<p>$$\therefore 1 = -1$$</p>

<h3>Problem 2:</h3>

<p>We know that $i^2 = -1$</p>

<p>$$i^2 = \sqrt{-1}\times\sqrt {-1}$$</p>

<p>$$i^2=\sqrt{-1  \times  -1}$$</p>

<p>$$i^2= \sqrt{1} = 1$$</p>

<p>But this contradicts:</p>

<p>$$i^2 = i \times i=\sqrt{-1}\times\sqrt {-1}$$</p>

<p>$$i^2 = -1$$</p>

<p>$$\therefore 1 = -1$$</p>

<h3>Problem 3:</h3>

<p>$$\frac{1}{i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-1}}$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{-1}} \times \frac{i}{i} = -i$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{i} = -i$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{i} =\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{-1}}$$</p>

<p>$$= \sqrt{\frac{1}{-1}} = i$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{i} =i$$</p>

<p>$$\therefore i = -i$$</p>

<p>All of the three problems above are truly challenging and can be quite misleading at first sight, I strongly encourage the reader to pause and attempt this as it is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<h2>Where does trigonometry come from?</h2>

<p>General knowledge already tells us that any complex number z can be represented in a real and imaginary part as a+bi.</p>

<p>However, once you dive deeper into the imaginary, you face this general formula for a complex point: $z = |z|(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$</p>

<h3>Here is a beautiful proof of how to derive this:</h3>

<p>Imagine a point in the complex plane: $z$</p>

<p>with the coordinates $a+bi$</p>

<p>To solve this, we draw a circle with the $radius = |z|$ because radius is a length and must be positive.</p>

<p>Therefore, through assumption, we know that the point z is on the circumference of this circle.</p>

<p>Let the angle that forms be $\theta$</p>

<p>Draw a triangle with the base of $a$ and height of $b$.</p>

<p>Now is the part where some get confused, using the basic trigonometric identities listed below, find $a$ and $b$ in terms of the $radius$ and $\theta$.</p>

<p>$$\sin x = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$$</p>

<p>$$\cos x = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$$</p>

<p>$$\tan x = \frac{opposite}{adjacent}$$</p>

<p>In this case, the opposite side would be $b$ and the adjacent side to $\theta$ would be $a$; so after following the steps, we get:</p>

<p>$$\sin \theta = \frac{b}{|z|}$$</p>

<p>$$b = |z|\sin \theta$$</p>

<p>If we continue this with the base...</p>

<p>$$\cos \theta = \frac{a}{|z|}$$</p>

<p>$$a = |z|\cos\theta$$</p>

<p>If we replace the values of $a$ and $b$ in the original equation of $a+bi$, we get:</p>

<p>$$z = |z|\cos\theta+i\times|z|\sin\theta$$</p>

<p>Factorise:</p>

<p>$$z = |z|(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$$</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{QED}$$</p>

<h2>How to derive $\sin(15)$</h2>

<p>When one is first introduced to trigonometry, they are tasked to learn the base values (0,30,45,60,90) of sine, cosine and tangent. However, 15 is not among the introductory values.</p>

<p>Assuming that one has not memorised the sine subtraction formula, how does one derive $\sin{15}$ ?</p>

<p>Imaginary numbers of course!</p>

<p>We know that $\sin 30 = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\sin 45 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$</p>

<p>$$45-30 = 15$$</p>

<p>However, a difference in the inputs of a function does not necessarily guarantee the same difference in output especially for a periodic function like sine and cosine.</p>

<p>This means $$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}- \frac{1}{2} \neq \sin15$$</p>

<p>But we can use the $arg()$ function which finds the angle between the x- axis (anti-clockwise ) and the line from the imaginary point z to the origin.</p>

<p>$$arg(a+b) =arg(a)\times arg(b)$$</p>

<p>So, lets use $r = 1$ to get the unit circle and plot the 2 points:</p>

<p>$$|1|(\cos 45+i\sin 45)$$</p>

<p>$$|1|(\cos 30+i\sin 30)$$</p>

<p>At this point, I strongly encourage the reader to try and attempt this problem as this can help bring real clarity to this topic.</p>

<p>Now , we use this rule...</p>

<p>$$arg(a+b) =arg(a)\times arg(b)$$</p>

<p>... but in reverse:</p>

<p>$$arg(a-b) =\frac{arg(a)}{ arg(b)}$$</p>

<p>So we get:</p>

<p>$$\frac{(\cos 45+i\sin 45)}{(\cos 30+i\sin 30)}$$</p>

<p>At this point the simplification should be $\mathbb{TRIVIAL}$</p>

<p>But for simplicity's sake, lets add an intermediate step to this:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-i\frac{1}{2}}$$</p>

<p>Using the complex conjugate and carefully multiplying the numerator and denominator both by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-i\frac{1}{2}$ we get the answer which is:</p>

<p>$$\sin 15 = \frac{\sqrt{6}-\sqrt{2}}{4}$$</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{QED}$$</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Understanding the world of imaginary numbers really gives one a new perspective into the spectacle that is mathematics. Imaginary numbers are used extensively in quantum computing and engineering and is a vital part of day to day mathematics, from its birth, it has always been like a slightly peculiar but refreshing sight to beginners and professionals alike. Overall, $i$ will be written as a tool in history with a strange origin and limitless applications.</p>
